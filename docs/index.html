<h1>hi, im anosuba!</h1>
<p>I am a 16-year-old, recreational and hobbyist programmer for 5 years. I mainly program with the Luau language &mdash; since most of my works are in relation to the Roblox engine &mdash; but I can read and write in any general-purpose language (C, Rust, Zig, and JS to name a few.), albeit with lesser fluency as I do with Luau.</p>
<p>This website's purpose is to serve as a personal blog where I archive my ideas and philosophy regarding development and programming practices.</p>
