This is the repository that houses [my personal weblog site](https://anothersubatomo.github.io/)!
There not much to say about it as of now as it is still in construction, but I can mention a few awesome facts about it!

* There is no frameworks involved; it is powered by pure HTML, CSS, & a little JS!
* The build system (static site generator) is manually-crafted and specifically tailored to my requirements and goal with the weblog; it is also purely written in Bash!
* All works are dedicated to the [public domain](./LICENSE). :heart:
